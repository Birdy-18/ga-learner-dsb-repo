### Project Overview

 This gives a brief knowledge about the manipulation of data using bumpy with variant examples and solutions. 


### Learnings from the project

 Learned about different concepts that can be used in the manipulation of data like mean, average finding, creating subset arrays, and more stuff. GO THROUGH TO EXPLORE MORE !! 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Different concepts and proper implementation  should be known by the programmer which gives us a broad view to write a command in minimal or even within a single line. 


### Challenges faced

 Different concepts and how to implement while solving subset arrays.
